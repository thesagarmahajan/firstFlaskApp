# Warmup for web developers who are new to flask!

As a web devloper you might have worked with PHP or node.js. No Matter which technology you are using,

in almost every project you are doing the same stuff. For example, Database Connections, REST API, etc

Creating Modules and libraries etc. 

    If you are shifting from PHP to Flask then this repository will help you to reduce you googling time!

In this project i am giving example code of all those stuff which you do frequently in every web development

project. Enjoy!
